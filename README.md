Indian flag using python

So, this year we are celebrating 75 years of our independence .
It may not be that exciting to us now ,being all grown up and shit, but 
We all can recall the memories of our childhood , schools , colony , socities ,
just so much enthusiasm was there.

So, salute our flag and pay homage to our fallen heroes.
Jai Hind!!
